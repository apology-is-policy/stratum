# Stratum v2 — technical reference

This document is the **as-built** reference for Stratum v2. It
describes what exists in the v2 tree today, where the relevant code
lives, which invariants the TLA+ specs pin, and how the subsystems
compose. It is not a roadmap and not a design document — see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for design intent and `docs/ROADMAP-V2.md`
for phased scope.

## How to read this

The reference is split by subsystem, one file per layer of the stack.
Each file follows the same template:

- **Purpose** — one paragraph on what the layer does and where it
  sits in the stack.
- **Public API** — every exported function with its contract.
- **Implementation** — structure + invariants + known caveats.
- **Spec cross-reference** — TLA+ modules that pin invariants for
  this layer; SPEC-TO-CODE mapping entries.
- **Tests** — which suites exercise the layer and what they cover.
- **Status** — what's implemented today vs. what's stubbed or
  deferred. Commit hashes cite the landing points.

When a section describes a detail enforced by a spec, the spec's
action / invariant name is in `backticks`. When a section cites a
file, the form is `path/to/file.c:line` so editors can jump there.

## Audience

- Engineers landing changes to the subsystem under discussion.
- Reviewers validating that a change matches the documented contract.
- Auditors checking that invariants still hold.

If you are here to learn Stratum from scratch, start with
`docs/VISION.md` → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → here. This reference
assumes you know what a Bε-tree is and why we want PQ-hybrid wrap.

## Snapshot

- **Tip**: `e5fe085` (R22 / P5-7 replace-resume close + slot-0 guard).
- **Phases**: 1–4 complete; Phase 5 in progress — through P5-7
  (replace_device_online resumes from ADDED-ONLINE partial state,
  closing R21's P2-1 + R22's slot-0 spoofing P3).
- **Tests**: 28 suites × (default + ASan + TSan) green. test_sync_multi
  holds 41 tests; test_pool 45; test_scrub 17.
- **Specs**: 13 TLA+ modules clean + 6 buggy-demo configs fire as expected.
- **LOC**: ~26 KLOC across 21 src/ modules + 25 public headers.

For phase-level status see `v2/docs/phase{2,3,4,5}-status.md`. The
reference below covers the as-built layers in bottom-up order.

This is a live document — every phase-chunk commit that touches a
subsystem updates the corresponding section in the same PR.

## Document maintenance

When a chunk lands (bug fix, refactor, new module), the author is
responsible for:

1. Updating the relevant reference/NN-*.md section(s).
2. Checking the [Snapshot](#snapshot) figures (tip / phase / test /
   spec counts) still match reality.
3. If the chunk introduces or refutes an invariant, updating
   `10-specs.md`'s SPEC-TO-CODE table.
4. If a new term or acronym enters the lexicon, updating
   `11-glossary.md`.

Reference sections are PR-first like any code change; the audit
policy in `CLAUDE.md` ("spec-first for load-bearing invariants")
extends here: a change to a documented invariant updates the spec
FIRST, then the reference, then the code. If the three disagree,
the spec wins.
