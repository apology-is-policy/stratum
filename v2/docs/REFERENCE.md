# Stratum v2 — technical reference

This document is the **as-built** reference for Stratum v2. It
describes what exists in the v2 tree today, where the relevant code
lives, which invariants the TLA+ specs pin, and how the subsystems
compose. It is not a roadmap and not a design document — see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for design intent and `docs/ROADMAP-V2.md`
for phased scope.

## How to read this

The reference is split by subsystem, one file per layer of the stack.
Each file follows the same template:

- **Purpose** — one paragraph on what the layer does and where it
  sits in the stack.
- **Public API** — every exported function with its contract.
- **Implementation** — structure + invariants + known caveats.
- **Spec cross-reference** — TLA+ modules that pin invariants for
  this layer; SPEC-TO-CODE mapping entries.
- **Tests** — which suites exercise the layer and what they cover.
- **Status** — what's implemented today vs. what's stubbed or
  deferred. Commit hashes cite the landing points.

When a section describes a detail enforced by a spec, the spec's
action / invariant name is in `backticks`. When a section cites a
file, the form is `path/to/file.c:line` so editors can jump there.

## Audience

- Engineers landing changes to the subsystem under discussion.
- Reviewers validating that a change matches the documented contract.
- Auditors checking that invariants still hold.

If you are here to learn Stratum from scratch, start with
`docs/VISION.md` → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → here. This reference
assumes you know what a Bε-tree is and why we want PQ-hybrid wrap.

## Snapshot

- **Tip**: TBD (P6-4 spec scaffold: `property.tla` + 3 configs;
  bumps spec posture to 17 modules / 20 fixed configs / 15 buggy
  demos). Phase 5 tagged `phase-5-complete` at `461e68e`.
- **Phases**: 1–5 complete; **Phase 6 entered 2026-04-26**.
  P6-1 (bptr.tla) at `032db86`; P6-2 (dataset.tla) at
  `75f6a3f`; P6-3 (snapshot.tla) at `8813027`; P6-4
  (property.tla inheritance) landing this commit. Spec-first
  scaffold series for ROADMAP §9.1's deliverables: bptr layer
  protocol + dataset hierarchy + snapshot lifecycle + property
  inheritance all modeled. Block-level dead-list (snapshot
  delete correctness) and clones still pending specs. C
  implementations pending across the board. Phase 7 pre-work
  (FastCDC, P6-independent) parallel-available.
- **Tests**: 28 suites × (default + ASan + TSan, serial) green.
  test_sync_multi 42; test_pool 48; test_scrub 30; test_alloc 32.
- **Specs**: 17 TLA+ modules clean (20 fixed configs: legacy +
  scrub_beta + scrub_durable + scrub_beta_durable + bptr +
  dataset + snapshot + property) + 15 buggy-demo configs fire
  as expected.
- **LOC**: ~26 KLOC across 21 src/ modules + 25 public headers.

For phase-level status see `v2/docs/phase{2,3,4,5}-status.md`. The
reference below covers the as-built layers in bottom-up order.

This is a live document — every phase-chunk commit that touches a
subsystem updates the corresponding section in the same PR.

## Document maintenance

When a chunk lands (bug fix, refactor, new module), the author is
responsible for:

1. Updating the relevant reference/NN-*.md section(s).
2. Checking the [Snapshot](#snapshot) figures (tip / phase / test /
   spec counts) still match reality.
3. If the chunk introduces or refutes an invariant, updating
   `10-specs.md`'s SPEC-TO-CODE table.
4. If a new term or acronym enters the lexicon, updating
   `11-glossary.md`.

Reference sections are PR-first like any code change; the audit
policy in `CLAUDE.md` ("spec-first for load-bearing invariants")
extends here: a change to a documented invariant updates the spec
FIRST, then the reference, then the code. If the three disagree,
the spec wins.
